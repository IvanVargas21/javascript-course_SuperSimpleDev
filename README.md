# javascript-course_SuperSimpleDev
This repository features JavaScript projects, code snippets, and exercises based on the "JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024)" from the YouTube channel SuperSimpleDev. It serves as a learning log, where I document progress and apply concepts directly from the video. Updates are made as I learn and commit new material.
